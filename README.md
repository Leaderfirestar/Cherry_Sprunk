This is a small, free-time java project. In my process to learn basic java, I decided it might be easiet to try and make something I might be familliar with. I used IntelliJ with gradle to build it, and used javacord to integrate it with discord. In the furture, I'd like to add more functionality, including joining voice calls and projecting audio.
